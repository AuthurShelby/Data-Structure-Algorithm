## 📂 Project Structure

### 🧱 Data Structures
Fundamental data structure implementations:
- **LL_queue** – Queue using Linked List
- **Linear_queue** – Queue using arrays (linear)
- **LinkedList** – Singly Linked List operations
- **Stack_LL** – Stack using Linked List

### 🎮 Puzzle-Based Problems
Algorithmic logic applied to classic problems:
- **TOH** – Tower of Hanoi (recursive solution)
- **Minesweeper** – Basic implementation of Minesweeper logic

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms
Techniques to search elements efficiently:
- **BinarySearch** – Divide and conquer method
- **InterpolationSearch** – Improved binary-like search for uniform distributions
- **LinearSearch** – Simple sequential search

### 🔃 Sorting Algorithms
Arrange data in a specific order using:
- **BubbleSort** – Repeated swapping
- **BucketSort** – Distribute into buckets and sort
- **CountSort** – Counting occurrences (non-comparison based)
- **InsertionSort** – Insert elements into correct position
- **MergeSort** – Divide and merge
- **Quicksort** – Divide and conquer using pivots
- **RadixSort** – Digit-by-digit sorting (non-comparison based)
- **SelectionSort** – Repeatedly select min/max element

### 🌳 Tree Algorithms
Work with hierarchical data:
- **AVL Tree** – Self-balancing binary search tree
- **BinarySearchTree** – Basic BST operations
- **Binary Tree** – Implemented using both arrays and linked lists

### 🧠 Other Algorithms
Miscellaneous algorithm solutions that don't fit neatly in the above categories.
