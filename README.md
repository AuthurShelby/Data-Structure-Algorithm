# DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It serves as a collection of essential problem-solving techniques, useful for coding interviews and competitive programming.

ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered:

âœ” Arrays â€“ Basic operations and manipulations

âœ” Linked Lists â€“ Singly and doubly linked list implementations

âœ” Sorting Algorithms â€“ Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.

âœ” Searching Algorithms â€“ Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.

âœ” Tower of Hanoi (TOH) â€“ Recursive solution

ðŸ›  Features:
Pure Python implementations

Well-structured and easy-to-understand code snippets

Focused on efficiency and fundamental problem-solving

ðŸ”— Feel free to explore, contribute, and use these implementations for learning and practice!
