This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It serves as a collection of essential problem-solving techniques, useful for coding interviews and competitive programming.

📌 Topics Covered:
✔ Arrays – Basic operations and manipulations
✔ Linked Lists – Singly and doubly linked list implementations
✔ Sorting Algorithms – Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
✔ Searching Algorithms – Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.
✔ Tower of Hanoi (TOH) – Recursive solution

🛠 Features:
Pure Python implementations

Well-structured and easy-to-understand code snippets

Focused on efficiency and fundamental problem-solving
